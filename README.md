Analysis on appstore statistics for someone who wants to make make an app and maximize their ratings.

### Interesting Findings:

- There are the most Game related apps followed by Entertainment and Education apps on the app store. Catalog and Medical apps are the least popular. Consider developing Catalog/Medical apps to avoid competition.
- On average, apps in the app store have a rating of 3.52. Thus it'd be good to try to beat this baseline if you would like your app to be considered high rating.
- Book, Catalogs and Health/Fitness apps have the highest average ratings, so one might consider developing these apps if we believe that the user base for these apps are likely to give higher ratings compared to other users. Sports apps had by far the lower average rating at 3.36 (with Finance apps right above that at 3.56). As such, if we think that Sports app users have a lower expectation for such apps, it might be worth trying to shoot for a stellar Sports app.
- Paid apps have higher rating that unpaid apps (beating it out by a solid 0.3 stars). The highest rating of apps were priced between 1-5 dollars. It should be worth noting that users who pay money for apps certainly have a higher expectation for tha app, so it might be worth considering lower priced options anyways. In any case, it largely depends on what the budget and business plan for the app is.
- Interestingly enough, apps with more than 1500 characters in their description had way higher ratings. This could simply be due to the fact that app creators who put a lot of time and resources in their app would more likely write a longer app description and also develop a better app.
- Apps with less supported devises actually netted higher ratings that app with more supported devices. This could suggest that app creators spent more time compatabilizing the app with each device, yielding better user experience. The takeaway is to try to perfect your app to less devices rather that make a mediocre app that caters to more devices.
- Finally, apps that supported 10-30 langauges yielded the highest ratings.

  In conclusion, I would recommend building a Catalog app that is at most $5. This app should support a few of the most common devices, while also supporting 10-30 languages.
